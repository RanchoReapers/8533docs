<h1> Build Season Overview </h1>

<h2> What is Build Season? </h2>

Build Season is the core period of the FRC year when teams design, build, program, and test their competition robot. It typically lasts 6-8 weeks, starting with Kickoff in early January and ending at the team's first competition.

<h2> Build Season Timeline </h2>

**Week 0 - Kickoff Weekend**:
- Game reveal and rule release
- Strategy discussions
- Initial design brainstorming
- Programming team plans software updates

**Weeks 1-2 - Planning and Setup**:
- **Mechanical**: CAD design and prototyping
- **Electrical**: Plan wiring and components
- **Programming**: Update software, import code, plan features
- **Strategy**: Analyze game, determine priorities

**Weeks 3-4 - Build and Core Programming**:
- **Mechanical**: Fabricate major components
- **Electrical**: Wire control system, mount components
- **Programming**: Implement drivetrain, basic subsystems
- Integration meetings to coordinate

**Weeks 5-6 - Integration and Features**:
- **Mechanical**: Assembly and mounting
- **Electrical**: Complete wiring, test all systems
- **Programming**: Add mechanisms, autonomous routines
- **All**: Integration testing

**Weeks 7-8 - Testing and Refinement**:
- Full robot testing
- Driver practice
- Autonomous refinement
- Reliability improvements
- Competition preparation

**Stop Build Day**: 
- All robot work must stop
- Final inspection and bagging (if required)
- Focus shifts to competition prep

<h2> Programming Team Responsibilities </h2>

- Calibrate swerve modules
- Begin autonomous planning
- Coordinate with mechanical/electrical

**Week 4-5**:
- Implement mechanism subsystems
- Create operator controls
- Begin autonomous routines
- Vision system integration
- Testing on practice field

**Week 6-7**:
- Complete all features
- Extensive testing and debugging
- Tune PID controllers
- Optimize autonomous
- Driver training support

**Week 8**:
- Final testing and validation
- Bug fixes only
- Competition preparation
- Documentation
- Backup plans

<h2> Key Programming Milestones </h2>

**Critical Path Items**:
- [ ] Drivetrain operational (Week 2)
- [ ] Swerve calibrated and tuned (Week 3)
- [ ] All subsystems functional (Week 5)
- [ ] One working autonomous (Week 6)
- [ ] All features complete (Week 7)
- [ ] Competition ready (Week 8)

**Important Deliverables**:
- Reliable teleoperated control
- Multiple autonomous routines
- Safety features and limits
- Vision integration (if applicable)
- Dashboard displays
- Documentation

<h2> Communication and Coordination </h2>

**Daily Stand-ups** (recommended):
- What did you accomplish?
- What are you working on today?
- Any blockers or issues?

**Integration Meetings** (2-3 times/week):
- Coordinate between subteams
- Discuss design changes
- Plan testing sessions
- Resolve conflicts

**Testing Sessions** (as often as possible):
- Test on actual hardware
- Get driver feedback
- Identify issues early
- Iterate quickly

<h2> Build Season Best Practices </h2>

**For Programming Team**:
- Commit code frequently with clear messages
- Test incrementally, not all at once
- Keep main branch stable
- Document as you go
- Have backup plans
- Don't wait until last week
- Communicate with other subteams
- Take breaks to avoid burnout

**Version Control**:
- Commit daily or more
- Use feature branches
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Tag important milestones
- Don't commit broken code to main
- Review each other's code

**Testing**:
- Test early and often
- Test on actual robot, not just simulation
- Create testing checklists
- Log issues in GitHub
- Retest after changes
- Involve drivers in testing

<h2> Managing Scope and Priorities </h2>

**Must-Have Features** (Week 1-6):
- Reliable drivetrain control
- Basic mechanism operation
- One working autonomous
- Safety features

**Should-Have Features** (Week 5-7):
- Advanced autonomous routines
- Vision assistance
- Automated sequences
- Optimizations

**Nice-to-Have Features** (Week 7-8):
- Advanced driver assists
- Complex auto strategies
- Additional dashboard features
- Polish and refinements

**Cut Features if Behind**:
- Focus on reliability over complexity
- Simple solutions often better
- Can add at next competition
- Don't sacrifice core functionality

<h2> Crisis Management </h2>

**When Things Go Wrong**:
- Don't panic - assess the situation
- Prioritize critical issues
- Get help from mentors
- Consider simple workarounds
- Document for future
- Learn from mistakes

**Common Build Season Crises**:
- Design changes requiring code updates
- Hardware failures or delays
- Features not working as expected
- Time running out
- Team member availability

**Contingency Plans**:
- Have fallback autonomous options
- Keep old working code accessible
- Maintain simple operation modes
- Practice with minimal features
- Don't be afraid to simplify

<h2> Competition Preparation </h2>

**Week Before Competition**:
- Code freeze (bug fixes only)
- Extensive testing
- Driver practice
- Create pit checklist
- Prepare backup systems

**At Competition**:
- Bring backup laptop with code
- USB cable and radio
- Bring documentation
- Know how to restore system
- Have contact info for mentors

<h2> Post-Build Season </h2>

After first competition:
- Document lessons learned
- Plan improvements for next comp
- Fix known issues
- Add missing features
- Share knowledge with team

<h2> Build Season Survival Tips </h2>

- **Pace yourself**: It's a marathon, not a sprint
- **Take breaks**: Tired programmers make mistakes
- **Ask for help**: Mentors and community are resources
- **Celebrate wins**: Acknowledge progress
- **Stay organized**: Use issues and project boards
- **Communicate**: Keep team informed
- **Be flexible**: Plans will change
- **Have fun**: It's supposed to be enjoyable!

<h2> Resources </h2>

**Within Team**:
- Mentors
- Other subteam members
- Previous year's code
- Team documentation

**External**:
- Chief Delphi forums
- FRC Discord
- WPILib documentation
- Vendor support
- Other team's code on GitHub

Build Season is intense but rewarding. Stay focused, work together, and remember why you joined FRC. Good luck!
