<h1> Build Season Notes </h1>

<h2> What is Build Season? </h2>

Build Season is the intense 6-8 week period following kickoff where FRC teams design, build, program, and test their competition robot for that year's game. It's the most critical time of the year for programming teams.

<h2> Programming Priorities During Build Season </h2>

**Week 1-2: Planning and Setup**:
- Analyze game requirements
- Plan robot capabilities and autonomous strategies
- Update software and firmware
- Set up new repository for season
- Import and update previous year's code

**Week 3-4: Core Systems**:
- Implement drivetrain control
- Create basic subsystems for mechanisms
- Test and tune PID controllers
- Begin autonomous path planning

**Week 5-6: Integration and Features**:
- Integrate all subsystems
- Add operator controls
- Implement autonomous routines
- Vision system integration
- Safety features and limits

**Week 7-8: Testing and Polish**:
- Extensive testing and debugging
- Optimize autonomous
- Practice driver training
- Create fallback strategies
- Document code

<h2> Important Notes to Track </h2>

Document these throughout build season:
- CAN IDs for all devices
- Tuned PID values
- Encoder offsets and calibrations
- Known bugs and workarounds
- Match strategy notes
- Configuration changes
- Lessons learned

<h2> Communication is Key </h2>

Programming team must coordinate with:
- **Mechanical team**: Hardware changes affect code
- **Electrical team**: Wiring affects device IDs
- **Design team**: Requirements drive features
- **Drive team**: Controls and strategy feedback
- **Mentors**: Technical guidance and review

<h2> Best Practices </h2>

- Commit code frequently with clear messages
- Test on real hardware as soon as possible
- Keep a testing checklist
- Have backup plans for critical features
- Document everything
- Don't wait until the last week to integrate
- Practice match procedures (autonomous selection, etc.)
