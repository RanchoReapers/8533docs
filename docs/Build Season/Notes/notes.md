<h1> Build Season Notes </h1>
!!! warning 
    The contents of the *Build Season* section are not applicable until after Kickoff. You can get started with some basics right after kickoff, specifically updating software. You cannot update software, tune swerve, or physically test any new subsystems you write until after the robot is built. 

!!! important
    Through build season, make sure to commit code frequently with clear commit messages. Comment your additions and document major changes. Test your code as frequently and as soon as possible.

<h2> Programming Priorities During Build Season </h2>

<h3> Step 1 - Kickoff </h3>
- Update software.
- Set up new repository for season.
- Import and update previous year's code.
- Talk to <abbr data-title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> Team -> You'll need to know what specific components will be going on the robot and how many motors each will use. Talk about planned behaviors for each component so you know what to program.
- Create basic subsystems for planned mechanisms, assuming <abbr data-title="Controller Area Network">CAN</abbr> IDs.
- Start creating basic autos.

<h3> Step 2 </h3>
!!! info
    You'll need a fully built and wired chassis to complete this step.
- Tune swerve.
- Update firmware for anything currently on the robot.
- Start training Limelight neural networks.
- Deploy 

<h3> Step 3 </h3>
!!! info
    You'll need the robot to be fully built with all components to complete this step.
- Update firmware for any remaining components.
- Update controls.
- Test autonomous routines.
- Test limelight integration.
- Practice driving the robot.
