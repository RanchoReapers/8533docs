<h1> Swerve Modules/Drive Overview </h1>

<h2> What is Swerve Drive? </h2>

Swerve drive is an advanced drivetrain system where each wheel can independently rotate and steer. This provides omnidirectional movement, allowing the robot to drive in any direction while rotating independently.

<h2> Swerve Module Components </h2>

Each swerve module consists of:
- Drive motor (NEO) - propels the wheel
- Steering motor (NEO) - rotates the module
- CANCoder - measures absolute steering angle
- Bevel gears for steering
- Module frame and mounting hardware

<h2> Advantages of Swerve Drive </h2>

Swerve drive provides:
- Omnidirectional movement (strafe in any direction)
- Independent rotation while driving
- Field-centric control for easier driving
- Superior maneuverability
- Efficient path following for autonomous
