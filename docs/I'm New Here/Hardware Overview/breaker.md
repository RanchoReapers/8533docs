<h1> Circuit Breaker Overview </h1>

<h2> What is a Circuit Breaker? </h2>

A circuit breaker is a safety device that automatically interrupts electrical flow when the current exceeds a safe level. In FRC robots, circuit breakers protect components from damage due to electrical overload.

<h2> Types of Breakers in FRC </h2>

FRC robots use several types of breakers:
- Main breaker (120A): Protects the entire robot
- Branch breakers (various amperage ratings): Protect individual circuits
- Snap Action breakers: Manual reset breakers for specific components

<h2> When Breakers Trip </h2>

If a breaker trips, it indicates an overcurrent condition. Common causes:
- Motor stall
- Short circuit
- Too many high-current devices on one circuit
- Damaged wiring
