<h1> CANCoders Overview </h1>

<h2> What is a CANCoder? </h2>

A CANCoder is a magnetic absolute encoder made by CTRE (Cross The Road Electronics). It provides precise position and velocity measurements over the CAN bus, making it ideal for mechanisms that need to know their exact position.

<h2> Key Features </h2>

CANCoders provide:
- Absolute position (maintains position through power cycles)
- 4096 counts per revolution resolution
- CAN bus communication
- Magnetic sensing (no physical contact)
- Velocity measurement
- Configurable units and offsets

<h2> Common Applications </h2>

CANCoders are used for:
- Swerve module steering position (absolute angle)
- Arm and elevator position tracking
- Turret angle measurement
- Any mechanism requiring absolute position feedback
- Determining mechanism positions during autonomous init
