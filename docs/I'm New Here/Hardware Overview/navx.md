<h2> Key Features </h2>

The NavX3-CAN provides:
- 3-axis gyroscope for rotation tracking
- 3-axis accelerometer for linear motion
- Magnetometer for compass heading
- Quaternion-based orientation calculations
- CAN bus communication

<h2> Common Applications </h2>

The NavX3-CAN is used for:
- Field-centric swerve drive control
- Auto-balancing on charging stations
- Precise autonomous turning
- Detecting tipping or collision
- Dead reckoning navigation
