<h1> SPARK MAX Motor Controllers Overview </h1>

<h2> What is the SPARK MAX? </h2>

The SPARK MAX is a brushless motor controller made by REV Robotics. It's designed to control NEO brushless motors and provides advanced features like PID control, motion profiling, and telemetry over CAN bus.

<h2> Key Features </h2>

The SPARK MAX provides:
- Brushless motor control for NEO and NEO 550 motors
- CAN bus and PWM control modes
- Onboard PID control
- Smart Motion for motion profiling
- Current limiting and monitoring
- USB and CAN configuration via REV Hardware Client
- Data port for external encoders

<h2> Configuration and Usage </h2>

To use a SPARK MAX:
- Connect to motor via integrated motor wires
- Set CAN ID using REV Hardware Client
- Update firmware to latest version
- Configure motor type (NEO/NEO 550)
- Set current limits appropriate for your mechanism
- Configure PID gains for closed-loop control
- Set idle mode (brake or coast)
