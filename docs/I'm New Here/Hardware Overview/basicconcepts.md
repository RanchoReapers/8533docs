<h1> Basic Hardware Concepts </h1>

<h2> What is FRC Hardware? </h2>

FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) hardware consists of all the physical electrical and mechanical components that make up a robot. Understanding these basic concepts is essential for building, maintaining, and troubleshooting your robot.

<h2> Core Hardware Components </h2>

The core hardware system includes:
- Control system (SystemCore/RoboRIO)
- Power distribution
- Motor controllers
- Motors
- Sensors
- Pneumatics (if used)

<h2> Electrical Safety </h2>

Always follow proper electrical safety procedures:
- Disconnect battery before working on electrical systems
- Check for proper wire gauges
- Ensure all connections are secure
- Use proper crimping tools for connectors
