<h1> REV Power Distribution Hub (PDH) Overview </h1>

<h2> What is the PDH? </h2>

The REV Power Distribution Hub (PDH) is the central power distribution system for FRC robots. It takes power from the battery and distributes it to all electrical components while providing current monitoring and circuit protection.

<h2> PDH Features </h2>

The PDH provides:
- 20 switchable high-current channels (40A each)
- 3 low-current channels (15A each) with smaller connectors
- Individual current monitoring for each channel
- CAN bus communication for telemetry
- Total current and voltage monitoring
- Built-in circuit breakers

<h2> Monitoring and Safety </h2>

The PDH enables:
- Real-time current draw monitoring for all channels
- Identifying power-hungry mechanisms
- Detecting electrical issues before they cause failures
- Logging power consumption data
- Automated current limiting in code
