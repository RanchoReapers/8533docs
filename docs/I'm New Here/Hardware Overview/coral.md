<h1> Google Coral USB Accelerator Overview </h1>

<h2> What is the Google Coral? </h2>

The Google Coral USB Accelerator is an AI hardware accelerator that plugs into the Limelight 3. It enables real-time neural network inference for custom object detection tasks like identifying game pieces.

<h2> How it Works </h2>

The Coral accelerator:
- Contains an Edge TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)
- Processes neural networks trained with TensorFlow
- Connects via USB to the Limelight 3
- Runs inference much faster than CPU-only processing
- Enables real-time object detection at high frame rates

<h2> FRC Applications </h2>

Common uses in FRC:
- Detecting game pieces (cones, cubes, notes, etc.)
- Classifying game piece types or colors
- Custom target detection not possible with traditional vision
- Running complex vision pipelines in parallel
- Improving detection accuracy over retroreflective vision
