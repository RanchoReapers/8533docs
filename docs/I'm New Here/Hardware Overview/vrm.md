<h1> Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) Overview </h1>

<h2> What is the VRM? </h2>

The Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) is a device that converts the 12V battery power to regulated 12V and 5V outputs. These regulated voltages power accessories like cameras, LED strips, and other devices that require stable voltage.

<h2> VRM Specifications </h2>

The VRM provides:
- Two 12V/2A regulated outputs
- Two 5V/2A regulated outputs  
- Overcurrent protection
- Reverse polarity protection

<h2> Common Uses </h2>

The VRM is typically used to power:
- Limelight and other vision cameras
- LED strips for signaling
- Custom circuits requiring regulated voltage
- Sensors that need stable 5V power
