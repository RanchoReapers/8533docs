<h1> How to Read Documentation Effectively </h1>

<h2> Start with the Right Document </h2>

Choose documentation based on your goal:
- **Learning a concept**: Start with tutorials and guides
- **Finding a specific method**: Use API reference
- **Troubleshooting**: Check troubleshooting guides and forums
- **Examples**: Look for sample code sections

<h2> Active Reading Strategy </h2>

Don't just passively read - engage with the material:

**1. Skim First**:
- Read headings and subheadings
- Look at code examples
- Identify relevant sections
- Get the big picture

**2. Read Carefully**:
- Focus on relevant sections
- Try to understand the concepts
- Note unfamiliar terms
- Check diagrams and tables

**3. Try Examples**:
- Copy and run example code
- Modify examples to test understanding
- Break examples to see error messages
- Compare results to documentation

**4. Take Notes**:
- Write down key points
- Document useful methods
- Note common patterns
- Create your own examples

<h2> Understanding Technical Writing </h2>

Technical documentation has specific conventions:

**Method Signatures**:
```java
public double setSpeed(double speed)
```
- `public`: access level
- `double`: return type
- `setSpeed`: method name
- `(double speed)`: parameter type and name

**Parameter Descriptions**:
- Often in format: `parameter - description`
- May include valid ranges or units
- Example: `speed - Motor speed from -1.0 to 1.0`

**Return Values**:
- Describes what the method returns
- Includes type and meaning
- Example: `Returns: Current velocity in meters per second`

<h2> Common Documentation Sections </h2>

**Overview**: High-level explanation of what something does
**Prerequisites**: What you need to know or have first
**Installation**: How to set up or import
**Quick Start**: Minimal example to get started
**API Reference**: Complete list of classes and methods
**Examples**: Working code samples
**Troubleshooting**: Common problems and solutions
**FAQ**: Frequently asked questions

<h2> Best Practices </h2>

- **Search effectively**: Use Ctrl+F to find specific terms
- **Follow links**: Documentation often references related topics
- **Check versions**: Make sure docs match your software version
- **Use multiple sources**: Cross-reference different documentation
- **Test as you read**: Try things in your own code
- **Read error messages**: They often contain helpful information
- **Don't skip basics**: Understanding fundamentals prevents issues later

<h2> When Documentation Isn't Clear </h2>

If documentation is confusing:
1. Look for video tutorials on the topic
2. Search for blog posts or team technical binders
3. Ask on Chief Delphi or FRC Discord with specific questions
4. Look at example robot code from successful teams
5. Experiment with simple test code
6. Ask experienced team members
