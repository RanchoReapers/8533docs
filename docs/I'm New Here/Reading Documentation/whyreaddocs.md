<h1> Why Read Documentation? </h1>

<h2> The Importance of Documentation </h2>

Reading documentation is one of the most important skills in programming and robotics. Good documentation habits will:
- Save you hours of troubleshooting
- Help you understand how components really work
- Enable you to use advanced features
- Prevent you from reinventing solutions
- Build your technical reading skills

<h2> Common Misconceptions </h2>

Many beginners avoid documentation because they think:
- "It's too technical" - Documentation is written for learners
- "I can figure it out myself" - You'll waste time on solved problems
- "I'll just ask someone" - They'll tell you to read the docs
- "It's boring" - It's actually faster than trial and error

<h2> When to Read Documentation </h2>

You should consult documentation when:
- Learning a new library or framework
- Encountering an error message
- Wanting to use a specific feature
- Optimizing existing code
- Debugging unexpected behavior
- Planning a new feature implementation

<h2> Types of Documentation </h2>

Different documentation serves different purposes:

**API Reference**:
- Lists all classes, methods, and parameters
- Shows method signatures and return types
- Essential for knowing what's available

**Tutorials and Guides**:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Best for learning concepts
- Show complete examples

**Examples and Sample Code**:
- Working code you can adapt
- Demonstrate best practices
- Great starting points

**Troubleshooting Guides**:
- Common problems and solutions
- Error message explanations
- Diagnostic procedures

<h2> Benefits for FRC Teams </h2>

Teams that read documentation:
- Spend less time stuck on problems
- Write better, more maintainable code
- Use hardware features correctly
- Avoid common mistakes
- Build expertise faster
- Perform better in competitions
