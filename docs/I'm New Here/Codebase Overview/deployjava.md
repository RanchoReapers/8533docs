<h1> /deploy Directory </h1>

<h2> What is the /deploy Directory? </h2>

The `deploy` directory (full path: `src/main/deploy/`) contains non-code resources that are deployed to the robot alongside your Java code. These files are accessible at runtime on the SystemCore/RoboRIO.

<h2> Common Files in /deploy </h2>

**Choreo Trajectories** (`choreo/` subdirectory):
- `.traj` files containing path waypoints
- Generated by Choreo trajectory planner
- Loaded at runtime using `Choreo.getTrajectory(name)`

**PathPlanner Paths** (`pathplanner/` subdirectory):
- `.path` files for autonomous routines
- Created in PathPlanner GUI
- Include waypoints, constraints, event markers

**Limelight Pipelines**:
- JSON files with vision pipeline configurations
- Backup/restore Limelight settings
- Version control camera configurations

**Custom Configuration Files**:
- JSON, YAML, CSV files for robot settings
- Field layouts
- Custom data files

<h2> Accessing Deploy Files </h2>

Deploy files are available at runtime:
```java
// Choreo trajectory
ChoreoTrajectory traj = Choreo.getTrajectory("MyPath");

// PathPlanner path
PathPlannerPath path = PathPlannerPath.fromPathFile("MyPath");

// Custom file using Filesystem
String path = Filesystem.getDeployDirectory() + "/myconfig.json";
File configFile = new File(path);
```

<h2> Deployment Process </h2>

When you deploy code:
1. Robot code is compiled to JAR file
2. Deploy directory contents are copied to robot
3. Files are placed in `/home/lvuser/deploy/` on SystemCore/RoboRIO
4. Old files are replaced with new versions

<h2> Best Practices </h2>

- Keep deploy files small (SystemCore/RoboRIO has limited storage)
- Use version control for all deploy files
- Organize files in subdirectories
- Document what each file is for
- Remove unused files
- Test file loading early in development

<h2> File Size Considerations </h2>

- Trajectories: Usually < 100 KB each
- Images: Avoid large images, use compressed formats
- Total deploy folder: Keep under 10 MB when possible
- Large files slow down deployment
