<h1> What is Git/GitHub? </h1>

<h2> Understanding Git </h2>

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to your code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, maintains a complete history of changes, and helps prevent code loss.

<h2> Understanding GitHub </h2>

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides:
- Cloud storage for your code
- Collaboration tools (pull requests, issues, discussions)
- Code review features
- Project management capabilities
- Team access control
- Integration with development tools
