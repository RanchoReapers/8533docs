<h1> Repositories, Branches, and Pull Requests </h1>

<h2> What is a Repository? </h2>

A repository (or "repo") is a folder that contains all of your project files and the complete version history. Each FRC project typically has its own repository.

Repositories contain:
- All code files
- Documentation
- Configuration files
- Complete commit history
- Branch information

<h2> What is a Branch? </h2>

A branch is an independent line of development within a repository. Branches allow you to:
- Work on features without affecting the main code
- Experiment safely
- Isolate bug fixes
- Collaborate without conflicts

Common branch names:
- `main` or `master`: The primary stable branch
- `dev` or `development`: Ongoing development branch
- Feature branches: `feature/new-intake`, `fix/auto-bug`

<h2> What is a Pull Request (PR)? </h2>

A Pull Request is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. PRs enable:
- Code review before merging
- Discussion about changes
- Automated testing
- Team approval workflow
- Documentation of why changes were made
