<h1> Staying Organized with GitHub Issues </h1>

<h2> What are GitHub Issues? </h2>

GitHub Issues are a project management tool built into GitHub. They help teams track:
- Bugs that need fixing
- Features to implement
- Questions about the code
- Documentation improvements
- Task assignments

<h2> Creating Effective Issues </h2>

A good issue includes:
- Clear, descriptive title
- Detailed description of the problem or feature
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Labels for categorization (bug, enhancement, documentation)
- Assignment to a team member
- Milestone association (optional)
- References to related issues or PRs

<h2> Using Issues for Team Organization </h2>

Issues help teams by:
- Creating a central task list
- Preventing duplicate work
- Tracking progress on features
- Documenting decisions and discussions
- Linking code changes to specific tasks
- Planning sprints and milestones
- Keeping history of problems and solutions

<h2> Issue Workflow </h2>

Typical issue lifecycle:
1. Create issue describing task/bug
2. Assign to a team member
3. Team member creates branch for the work
4. Work is done and PR is created
5. PR references the issue (e.g., "Fixes #42")
6. PR is reviewed and merged
7. Issue automatically closes when PR merges
