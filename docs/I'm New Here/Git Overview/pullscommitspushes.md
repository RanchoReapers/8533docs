<h1> Pulls, Pushes, and Commits </h1>

<h2> What is a Commit? </h2>

A commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. It records:
- What files were changed
- What the changes were
- Who made the changes
- When the changes were made
- A message describing why the changes were made

<h2> What is a Push? </h2>

Pushing uploads your local commits to the remote repository (GitHub). This:
- Backs up your code to the cloud
- Makes your changes visible to teammates
- Updates the team's shared codebase
- Enables others to pull your changes

<h2> What is a Pull? </h2>

Pulling downloads commits from the remote repository to your local machine. This:
- Gets the latest code changes from teammates
- Syncs your local repository with the team's work
- Prepares your workspace for new changes
- Should be done before starting new work
