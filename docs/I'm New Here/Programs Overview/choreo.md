<h1> Choreo Overview </h1>

<h2> What is Choreo? </h2>

Choreo is a trajectory generation and path planning tool designed specifically for FRC robots. It allows you to create smooth, optimized autonomous paths visually and export them for use in your robot code.

<h2> Key Features </h2>

Choreo provides:
- Visual path editor with field overlay
- Real-time path optimization
- Support for swerve drive kinematics
- Trajectory constraint handling (velocity, acceleration)
- Export to various formats for WPILib
- Integration with PathPlanner
- Real robot simulation

<h2> Creating Autonomous Paths </h2>

To use Choreo:
- Define your robot's physical parameters
- Draw paths on the field using waypoints
- Set constraints for each path segment
- Preview trajectory timing and velocities
- Export trajectories for robot code
- Test paths in simulation before competition
